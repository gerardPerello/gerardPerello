The majority of the projects on my GitHub profile are recent additions. This is because some of them were created several years ago, before I had knowledge of GitHub, or because they are part of private repositories that I cannot fork. These projects serve as a means to showcase my work. Below is an index to help you navigate through them.

- [Interactive Multi Point Cloud Rendering with Ray Tracing with C++/GLSL](https://github.com/gerardPerello/InteractiveMultiPointCloudRenderingWithRayTracingPublic). This is the demonstration of my final thesis project, where I developed a program for the visualization of Multi Point Cloud using ray tracing techniques. Additionally, I designed a novel optimized data structure called Multi-Octree. As we are planning to publish the code, it is currently not available for public access. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.
- [Algorithms for a stitching reconstruction of holographic microscope images // Python](https://github.com/gerardPerello/AlgorithmsForStitchingReconstructionHolographicMicroscopePublic): This project involved the implementation of Python algorithms for stitching and reconstructing holographic microscope images during my time collaborating with the research team ChipScope at UB (University of Barcelona). The objective was to merge multiple microscope-captured images and generate a single, comprehensive image with enhanced details.
- [ERP basis for Supermarkets with C#](https://github.com/gerardPerello/ERPBasisForSupermarketsPublic): I have designed and developed the fundamental components of a functional Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system customized for supermarkets during my time at Sertec Pesage S.L, a subsidiary of Mettler Toledo in Spain. I enhanced their existing ERP system to support multi-store functionality. Unfortunately, I am unable to share any specific details or publish the project at this time.
- [Android app with Kotlin](https://github.com/gerardPerello/AndroidSportsApp) : This is an Android application developed using the Kotlin programming language. The app is focused on sports-related functionality and features.
- [Sports basic WebPage back and front](https://github.com/gerardPerello/SportsBasicWebPage): I created a sports website that allows users to log in and purchase tickets for matches. The website was deployed on Heroku.
- [Hula App Design with Figma](https://framer.com/share/Hula-V-1--wx1mVPIsYdUTuJHfFHiU/df17ngMoi): I also enjoy designing my own mock-ups using Photoshop or Figma/Framer. Here is an example of an app called Hula, which is a ticket-selling application for nightclubs.
- [Sponge Bob Fractal Implementation with GLSL](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/fdKyWz): This project presents an implementation of a Sponge Bob fractal using GLSL, a shading language used for graphics programming. The provided link allows you to view the fractal visualization.
- [Wordle game with Java](https://github.com/gerardPerello/WordleWithJava): I developed a client-server project that enables multiple clients to connect to a central server and engage in the popular word game, Wordle. The server operates continuously, allowing clients to join or exit the game at their convenience.


Apart from the showcased projects, my experience also includes involvement in additional projects not currently displayed here. Some of these projects involve:

- Developing media players.
- Creating retro-style games.
- Building recommendation systems for movies and TV shows using machine learning techniques.
- Implementing a reinforcement learning algorithm to play Pac-Man, as part of the Berkeley University project.
