The majority of the projects on my GitHub profile are recent additions. This is because some of them were created several years ago, before I had knowledge of GitHub, or because they are part of private repositories that I cannot fork. These projects serve as a means to showcase my work. Below is an index to help you navigate through them.

- [Interactive Multi Point Cloud Rendering with Ray Tracing with C++/GLSL](https://github.com)
- [Android app with Kotlin](https://github.com)
- [Sports basic WebPage back and front](https://github.com)

Apart from the showcased projects, my experience also includes involvement in additional projects not currently displayed here. Some of these projects involve:

- Developing media players.
- Creating retro-style games.
- Building recommendation systems for movies and TV shows using machine learning techniques.
- Implementing a reinforcement learning algorithm to play Pac-Man, as part of the Berkeley University project.
